                    <h5>Radio-controlled cars (or RC cars for short) are miniature model cars or trucks that can be controlled from a distance using a specialized transmitter or remote. The term "RC" has been used to mean both "remote controlled" and "radio controlled", where "remote controlled" includes vehicles that are controlled by radio, infrared or a physical wire connection (the latter is now obsolete). Common use of "RC" today usually refers only to vehicles controlled by radio, and this article focuses on radio-controlled vehicles only.[1]

                        Cars are powered by various sources. Electric models are powered by small but powerful electric motors and rechargeable nickel-cadmium, nickel metal hydride, or lithium polymer cells. There are also brushed or brushless electric motors - brushless motors are more powerful and efficient, but also much more expensive than brushed motors. Most fuel-powered models use glow plug engines, small internal combustion engines fueled by a special mixture of nitromethane, methanol, and oil (in most cases a blend of castor oil and synthetic oil). These are referred to as "nitro" cars. Recently, exceptionally large models have been introduced that are powered by small gasoline engines, similar to string trimmer motors, which use a mix of oil and gasoline. Electric cars are generally considered easier to work with compared to fuel-driven models, but can be equally as complex at the higher budget and skill levels. Both electric and nitro models can be very fast, although electric is easier to upgrade and more versatile.

                        In both of these categories, both on-road and off-road vehicles are available. Off-road models, which are built with fully functional off-road suspensions and a wide tire selection, can be used on various types of terrain. On-road cars, with a much less robust suspension, are limited to smooth, paved surfaces. There are also rally cars, which fall somewhere between on-road and off-roadand can be driven on gravel, dirt or other loose surfaces. In the past decade, advances in "on-road" vehicles have made their suspension as adjustable as many full scale race cars, today.</h5>

            <h4>Creating Fun Since 1986
                Excitement is what it is all about! HPI cars and trucks are renowned for their exceptional durability, innovative designs and high quality, but most of all they are FUN!

                HPI products are enjoyed by hobbyists of all ages, from beginners to enthusiasts, with an eye for something special.

                It all started in 1986: with a small investment and a lot of hard work, Tatsuro Watanabe began Hobby Products International in Southern California, the world’s biggest hotspot for RC (Radio Control) models and products. The initial product range included car accessories like graphite parts for existing race cars, wheels for off-road and on-road vehicles and motors. The Uno motors even won a World Championship title in 1987, proving that the company had what it takes to compete with the top companies in the world! This early success allowed HPI to grow the product range quickly and eventually release the first car kit designed by HPI, the Super F1.

                More sales success led to HPI substantially increasing the size of the design team, and more kits and options soon followed. From here things went fast, rapidly shifting HPI's focus from being an accessories company to being one of the most prolific RC companies in the world. From the initial electric-powered car kits, the HPI product line expanded into fuel-powered RC with the Nitro RS4, off-road with the RS4 MT, small-scale RC with the Micro RS4 and eventually into bigger and bigger kits like the legendary Savage monster truck and Baja 1/5th scale buggy and truck series of vehicles. Along the way, HPI cars and trucks won plaudits and awards from RC media and fans alike, with web pages and fan groups helping to spread the word about HPI Racing.

                HPI car designs were used as the basis for the HB brand of pure racing cars, and this led to the brand's first World Championship win in 2006 in the ISTC on-road racing category. In off-road racing, the D8 buggy won its first World Championship in 2008, and further commitment to racing development saw many more off-road championship wins around the world, including multiple US National wins and 2 more buggy World Championship wins.

                The RS4 series - One of the very first electric touring car racers
                The Nitro RS4 - Kickstarted the nitro touring car movement
                The Micro RS4 - Created the 1/18th scale car category
                The Savage - Popularized the 1/8th scale monster truck category
                The Baja 5B – The first popular large scale 1/5th scale off-road RC vehicle
                HB Cyclone - IFMAR World Champion Touring Car (2006, Andy Moore, Italy)
                HB D8 - IFMAR World Champion 1/8th buggy (2008, Atsushi Hara, USA)
                The Savage XS - The fastest Mini Monster Truck in the world (65+mph/105 km/h)
                HB D812 - IFMAR World Champion 1/8th buggy (2012, Ty Tessmann, Sicily)
                The Baja Q32 - The first micro-scale car with Real Steer control
                In 2016, the 30th anniversary year of HPI Racing, HPI and HB brands parted ways as HPI Racing came under the ownership of Ripmax, the largest RC distributor in the United Kingdom and the largest Futaba distributor in Europe.

                Thanks for your interest in HPI Racing® products – we think they’re the best in the world, and we know you will, too!</h4>
